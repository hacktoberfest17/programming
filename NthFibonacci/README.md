## The Nth Fibonacci Term
### Algorithm

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

* The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
* The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
* And the 5 is (2+3),
* and so on!

### Output of the program
* `Enter the number of term to be printed: 10`
* `Output: 55`
