    "# Advanced Recommender Systems with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the node book for creating \"Advanced Recommender Systems\" with Python. This is an optional lesson notebook for you to check out. Due to the math level currently used and the heavy use of SciPy here, we have not posted videos for this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation Systems are often based on larger data sets and need to be organized in a particular way. Therefore, we will not have a project compatible with this topic, but rather a more intense review of building a recommendation system with Python with the same Movie Lens Dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Methods Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Two most common types of recommender systems are **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on the knowledge of users' attitudes towards items, that is, it uses the \"wisdom of the crowd\" to suggest items.\n",
    "* Content-based recommendation systems focus on the characteristics of the items and give you suggestions based on the similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaborative Filtering (CF)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from a general application perspective). The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means it can start learning by itself what features to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "CF can be divided into **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Model-Based Collaborative filtering**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Model-based Collaborative Filtering is based on **matrix factorization (MF)** which has received greater exposure, mainly as an unsupervised learning method for latent variable decomposition and dimensionality reduction. Matrix factorization is widely used for recommender systems where it can deal better with scalability and sparsity than Memory-based CF. The goal of MF is to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items. \n",
    "When you have a very sparse matrix, with a lot of dimensions, by doing matrix factorization you can restructure the  user-item matrix into low-rank structure, and you can represent the matrix by the multiplication of two low-rank matrices, where the rows contain the latent vector. You fit this matrix to approximate your original matrix, as closely as possible, by multiplying the low-rank matrices together, which fills in the entries missing in the original matrix.\n",

By applying matrix factorization the model learns that important user features are _age group (under 10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-90)_, _location_ and _gender_, and for movie features it learns that _decade_, _director_ and _actor_ are most important. Now if you look into the information you have stored, there is no such feature as the _decade_, but the model can learn on its own. The important aspect is that the CF model only uses data (user_id, movie_id, rating) to learn the latent features. If there is little data available model-based CF model will predict poorly, since it will be more difficult to learn the latent features. \n",
